# blinking_skirt
A blinking skirt - hardware prototyping project

Code and how-to mostly inspired from https://learn.adafruit.com/sparkle-skirt/overview

But a few changes have been made to the code to make it work.
Because this project uses sequins instead of neo-pixels.
Both of them are available on adafruit website if you are in the
US. I got them from ProtoCentral which is in Bangalore, India.
